# The DP Project


> What's the project about?

Keeping up with the current trend, the class will focus on constructing a website that provides visitors with information about the COVID crisis that is relevant to them based on their current location. Each student will be asked to build their own ‘location-relevant information site’ based on a dataset of their choice. By design, it is up to students to define what dataset to use, what they consider to be relevant information, and how they choose to present the information. The course is designed to provide students with the tools to develop and realize their ideas within the scope of this prompt. 

> What are the requirements?

The website needs to meet the following criteria:
1. Data: The website can only use (i) a user’s location and (ii) 1 -2 datasets (CSV file or API-based)
2. Languages: The website needs to use: (i) HTML/CSS/JavaScript, (ii) Python and (iii) Flask. 
3. Documentation: The codebase needs to be available on the student’s Github repository.
4. Hosting: The website needs to be deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

> What is the deadline?

Final project submissions will be due on Sunday, May 10th. All submitted projects that meet the above criteria will be included in an end-of-semester student showcase (date and formatted to be announced).
