> What resources should I look at if I want to learn more about the topics covered?

Here are some additional resources you might want to look at if you want to 'upgrade' your coding environment (Sublime + Terminal / WIndows PowerShell):

* (Mac only) iTerm2 is a Terminal replacement that comes with additional functionalities that are designed to improve your coding experience: https://www.iterm2.com/

* (Mac only) SendText is a Sublime Text plug-in that allows you to 'send' code you have written from Sublime Text to the Terminal (or iTerm2) simply by pressing ```cmd+Enter```: https://github.com/wch/SendText
