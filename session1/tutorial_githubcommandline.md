# Getting Started With The Github Command Line Tool
*Session 1 Mini-Tutorial*

Let's walk through some basic commands in git. Note that this tutorial assumes that you already have git installed from the terminal tutorial. 

**Step 1: Create the directory that will contain your git repo**

Mac users should launch terminal and Windows users should launch powershell to navigate to the directory where they will be saving work from this class. You can use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory. If you're okay with creating a directory on your desktop, simply type the following:

![create working directory](/assets/createdir.png)

The `pwd` command confirms that you've switched into the directory you just created.

**Step 2: Initialize git within this directory**

Use the command `git init` as such:

![create working directory](/assets/createdir.png)
