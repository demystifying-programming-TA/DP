# Setting Up A Local Webserver (Python)
*Session 2 Setup Guide*

You will be using Python to run a local web server - a critical tool in the local web development work flow. The below instructions will walk you through the process for setting up Python 3. 

**Mac**

*This guide assumes that you have already installed/set-up the [Terminal](/session1/setup_terminal.md)*

Mac OS X comes with Python 2.7 out of the box. Try typing ```python --version``` into the Terminal. You should see something like ```Python 2.7.16``` (the last two digits may vary depending on the date of your most recent software update). 

As of 2020, Python 2.7 has officially been deprecated which is why you should install Python 3 - while the syntax of Python 2/3 is the same for the most part, there are differences! 

To install Python 3 using Homebrew - the package manager which you installed in the [Terminal Set Up Guide](/session1/setup_terminal.md) enter ```brew install python``` into the Terminal. 

Once the installation completes, type ```python3 --version``` into the Terminal. Hopefully, you will see ```Python 3.7.7``` (*Python 3.7.7 is the most recent version at the time of writing*). 

Keeping Python up-to-date is good practice, you can upgrade Python using the Terminal command ```brew upgrade python3```.
