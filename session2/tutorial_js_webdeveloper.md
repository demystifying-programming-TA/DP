# Dynamic Frontend Development - Part I 
#### JavaScript + Web Developer Tools

*Session 2 Mini-Tutorial*


**This guide assumes that you have already installed/set-up the [Terminal](/session1/setup_terminal.md) or [Windows PowerShell](/session1/setup_windows_powershell.md) and [Sublime Text](/session1/setup_sublime.md). It also assumes you've completed the [HTML](/session2/tutorial_html_webserver.md) and [CSS](/session2/tutorial_css.md) portion skeleton from the previous exercise**


**Step 0: Open your ```index.html``` file**

Open your  ```index.html``` folder by going into Sublime --> File --> Open. Go to your Frontend Folder and open your ```index.html``` file. 

**Step 1: Link your JS page to your HTML page**

Connect your JS file with your ```index.html ``` page by using the following  tag  ```<script type="text/javascript" src="function.js"></script>  ``` in between your <head> </head> tags. If your html page is not in the same directory or subdirectory as your function.js file state the name of the directory within the href tag. (i.e.  ```src="Desktop/function.js" ``` ) 


**Step 2: Create an ```InitializeGraph``` function that obtains the user's location**

**Step 3: Link your html button to the ```InitializeGraph``` function **

**Step 4: Create an ```DrawGraph``` function that visualizes a given set of location-specific data**

**Step 5: Link your two functions, substituting hard-coded data for an API call to the backend**

**Step 6: Commit your updated repository to Github**
Follow the steps outlined in the [Github Command Line](/session1/tutorial_githubcommandline.md) tutorial to commit your code to Github.
