*Session 3 Resources*

**What resources should I look at if I want to learn more about the topics covered?**

* We used iPython in class rather than the default 'Python' shell - see [this link](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) if you are interested in learning more about what makes iPython superior.

* Extracting rows and columns from a Pandas Dataframe is a critical skill, [this guide](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/03-index-slice-subset/) reviews some of the indexing methods covered in class and introduces some more advanced methods. 

* If you would like to learn more about Object Orientated Programming, [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) provides a good overview of classes, objects, and attributes in Python.
